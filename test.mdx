# Welcome to EduBlog: Your Gateway to Knowledge

This is our first blog post using MDX in Next.js. MDX allows us to use JSX in our markdown content, which means we can include React components directly in our blog posts!

Here's an example of using a custom component:

```jsx
<CustomComponent>
  This is a custom component in MDX!
</CustomComponent>
```

## Features of MDX

1. Write JSX in your markdown files
2. Use React components in your content
3. Write markdown with all the features you love

MDX makes it easy to create rich, interactive blog posts. Happy blogging!
